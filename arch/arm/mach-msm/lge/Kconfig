	  This patch is added for gram-embedded device like mddi.
	  because, when suspend state, power of mddi is off usually,
	  gram of DDI chip has garbage data until data of gram is refreshed.
	  this can cause displaying broken screen in time of turning backlight on.
	  for preventing this problem, add refreshing routine before turning 
	  backlight on by using late resume mechanism.
